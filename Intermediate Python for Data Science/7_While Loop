while: warming up

The while loop is like a repeated if statement. The code is executed over and over again, as long as the condition is True. Have another look at its recipe.

while condition :
    expression

Can you tell how many printouts the following while loop will do?

x = 1
while x < 4 :
    print(x)
    x = x + 1

    Basic while loop

Below you can find the example from the video where the error variable, initially equal to 50.0, is divided by 4 and printed out on every run:

error = 50.0
while error > 1 :
    error = error / 4
    print(error)

This example will come in handy, because it's time to build a while loop yourself! We're going to code a while loop that implements a very basic control system for an inverted pendulum. If there's an offset from standing perfectly straight, the while loop will incrementally fix this offset.


    Create the variable offset with an initial value of 8.
    Code a while loop that keeps running as long as offset is not equal to 0. Inside the while loop:
    Print out the sentence "correcting...".
    Next, decrease the value of offset by 1. You can do this with offset = offset - 1.
    Finally, print out offset so you can see how it changes.

# Initialize offset
offset=8

# Code the while loop
while offset != 0:
    print("correcting...")
    offset=offset-1
    print(offset)
    
    Add conditionals

The while loop that corrects the offset is a good start, but what if offset is negative? You can try to run the sample code on the right where offset is initialized to -6, but your sessions will be disconnected. The while loop will never stop running, because offset will be further decreased on every run. offset != 0 will never become False and the while loop continues forever.

Fix things by putting an if-else statement inside the while loop.

# Initialize offset
offset = -6

# Code the while loop
while offset != 0 :
    print("correcting...")
    if offset > 0 :
        offset = offset - 1
    else :
        offset = offset + 1
    print(offset)

    Inside the while loop, replace offset = offset - 1 by an if-else statement:
        If offset is greater than zero, you should decrease offset by 1.
        Else, you should increase offset by 1.
    If you've coded things correctly, hitting Submit Answer should work this time.
