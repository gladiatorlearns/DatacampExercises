Random float

Randomness has many uses in science, art, statistics, cryptography, gaming, gambling, and other fields. You're going to use randomness to simulate a game.

All the functionality you need is contained in the random package, a sub-package of numpy. In this exercise, you'll be using two functions from this package:

    seed(): sets the random seed, so that your results are the reproducible between simulations. As an argument, it takes an integer of your choosing. If you call the function, no output will be generated.
    rand(): if you don't specify any arguments, it generates a random float between zero and one.


    Import numpy as np.
    Use seed() to set the seed; as an argument, pass 123.
    Generate your first random float with rand() and print it out.

# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# Set the seed
np.random.seed(123)

# Generate and print random float
print(np.random.rand())

Roll the dice

In the previous exercise, you used rand(), that generates a random float between 0 and 1.

As Filip explained in the video you can just as well use randint(), also a function of the random package, to generate integers randomly. The following call generates the integer 4, 5, 6 or 7 randomly. 8 is not included.

import numpy as np
np.random.randint(4, 8)

Numpy has already been imported as np and a seed has been set. Can you roll some dice?\\


    Use randint() with the appropriate arguments to randomly generate the integer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. This simulates a dice. Print it out.
    Repeat the outcome to see if the second throw is different. Again, print out the result.


# Import numpy and set seed
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)

# Use randint() to simulate a dice
print(np.random.randint(1,7))

# Use randint() again
print(np.random.randint(1,7))

Determine your next move

In the Empire State Building bet, your next move depends on the number of eyes you throw with the dice. We can perfectly code this with an if-elif-else construct!

The sample code assumes that you're currently at step 50. Can you fill in the missing pieces to finish the script? numpy is already imported as np and the seed has been set to 123, so you don't have to worry about that anymore.


    Roll the dice. Use randint() to create the variable dice.
    Finish the if-elif-else construct by replacing ___:
    If dice is 1 or 2, you go one step down.
    if dice is 3, 4 or 5, you go one step up.
    Else, you throw the dice again. The number of eyes is the number of steps you go up.
    Print out dice and step. Given the value of dice, was step updated correctly?


# Numpy is imported, seed is set

# Starting step
step = 50

# Roll the dice
dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

# Finish the control construct
if dice <= 2 :
    step = step - 1
elif dice <= 5 :
    step = step + 1
else :
    step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

# Print out dice and step
print(dice)
print(step)

The next step

Before, you have already written Python code that determines the next step based on the previous step. Now it's time to put this code inside a for loop so that we can simulate a random walk.


    Make a list random_walk that contains the first step, which is the integer 0.
    Finish the for loop:
    The loop should run 100 times.
    On each iteration, set step equal to the last element in the random_walk list. You can use the index -1 for this.
    Next, let the if-elif-else construct update step for you.
    The code that appends step to random_walk is already coded.
    Print out random_walk.

# Numpy is imported, seed is set

# Initialize random_walk
random_walk = [0]

# Complete the ___
for x in range(100) :
    # Set step: last element in random_walk
    step = random_walk[-1]

    # Roll the dice
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

    # Determine next step
    if dice <= 2:
        step = step - 1
    elif dice <= 5:
        step = step + 1
    else:
        step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

    # append next_step to random_walk
    random_walk.append(step)

# Print random_walk
print(random_walk)

How low can you go?

Things are shaping up nicely! You already have code that calculates your location in the Empire State Building after 100 dice throws. However, there's something we haven't thought about - you can't go below 0!

A typical way to solve problems like this is by using max(). If you pass max() two arguments, the biggest one gets returned. For example, to make sure that a variable x never goes below 10 when you decrease it, you can use:

x = max(10, x - 1)


    Use max() in a similar way to make sure that step doesn't go below zero if dice <= 2.

# Numpy is imported, seed is set

# Initialize random_walk
random_walk = [0]

for x in range(100) :
    step = random_walk[-1]
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

    if dice <= 2:
        # Replace below: use max to make sure step can't go below 0
        step = max(0, step - 1)
    elif dice <= 5:
        step = step + 1
    else:
        step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

    random_walk.append(step)

print(random_walk)

Visualize the walk

Let's visualize this random walk! Remember how you could use matplotlib to build a line plot?

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()

The first list you pass is mapped onto the x axis and the second list is mapped onto the y axis.

If you pass only one argument, Python will know what to do and will use the index of the list to map onto the x axis, and the values in the list onto the y axis.

Add some lines of code after the for loop:

    Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
    Use plt.plot() to plot random_walk.
    Finish off with plt.show() to actually display the plot.

# Numpy is imported, seed is set

# Initialization
random_walk = [0]

for x in range(100) :
    step = random_walk[-1]
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

    if dice <= 2:
        step = max(0, step - 1)
    elif dice <= 5:
        step = step + 1
    else:
        step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

    random_walk.append(step)

# Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot random_walk
plt.plot(random_walk)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
